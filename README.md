The aim of the project is to acquire basic skills in the design and implementation of digital
circuits. Learn to describe these circuits in VHDL and gain experience with their simulation using
the Modelsim tool.

As an example of the component on which you will acquire these skills, we will use the component for
receiving and transmitting data over an asynchronous serial line (UART - Universal Asynchronous
Receiver-Transmitter).

For simplicity, we will implement only a selected part of this controller, more specifically we will focus on the
receiving part responsible for processing data from the serial line and their reconstruction (parallelization).
Compared to a full-fledged UART controller, we will consider a number of other simplifications so that the
overall complexity of the project does not exceed the tolerable limit.
